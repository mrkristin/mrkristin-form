# simple-form-styles
mrk-form.css is a stylesheet to make many form components look _better_ across browsers.
normalize.css is not required, but is recommended

*IE and EDGE are outliers*

A quick check of the styles is available as a [github io Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mrkristin/mrkristin-form/blob/master/index.html)
 
additional documentation is forthcoming
