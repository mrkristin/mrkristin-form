# mrkristin-form
mrk-form.css is a bunch of simple CSS form styles which work across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. *IE and EDGE have not been tested yet.*

A quick check of the styles is available as a [github io Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mrkristin/mrkristin-form/blob/master/index.html)
 
additional documentation is forthcoming
